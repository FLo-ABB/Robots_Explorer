# [ðŸ”Ž Robots_Explorer](https://flo-abb.github.io/Robots_Explorer/)

This website provides information and charts about industrial robots from different manufacturers, including their reach and payload. The goal is to give a tool to easily compare different robots and their capabilities. It's a similar idea to [RoboDK's comparator](https://robodk.com/industrial-robots-charts/index.html?d=6&rc=1400&p=7.0&w=79&rp=0.030).

# Contributions are welcome!
If you want to help to improve the website, please open an issue with the description of your idea: [Issues](https://github.com/FLo-ABB/Robots_Explorer/issues) They will be always welcome! Data is from [RoboDK's Robots Library](https://robodk.com/library) so if you want to add a robot, please add it there first. This website will be updated automatically.
